# DATA4SDGs-Highways

## Technology

#### Backend

We're using `node >= 7.4` with `express ^4.13.3` to serve our application and the twitter data that feeds our twitter slider. Twitter data is being fetch with the twitter js SDK: `twitter ^1.7.0`.

#### Frontend

We're using `vue ^2.0.1` as our frontend framework, `vue-router ^2.0.2` for internal routing, and `vuex ^2.0.0` for application state management.
For the application's http request console we're using `httpsnippet ^1.16.5` and for the maps visualisations we use `leaflet ^1.0.2`. Finally for the application styles we use the node implementation of sass: `node-sass ^4.2.0`.

#### Code Quality

For javascript code quality we depend on Eslint. We're using `eslint^3.7.1`  and you can find our eslint config in the `.eslintrc.js` file.

#### Tooling

This project is built on top of ES6 javascript, which means we're using ES6 modules and the latest syntax. For this to be able to run on a browser we need a module bundler and a transpiler. We're using `webpack ^1.13.2` as a module bundler and `babel ^6.0.0` as a transpiler.

## Requirements

- Node 7.4+
- NPM

## Installation

First install dependencies running in your projects folder inside the terminal:

```

npm install

````
After the installation is completed, create a new file and name it `.env`. Copy the content of the project's `.env.sample` file in it. And fill in the blanks with the appropriate values. The values correspond to the following things:
* API_BASE_URL - Map layers + datasets api base url. This should point to the _resource-watch_ api.
* TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY - twitter consumer key (needed for tweets slider).
* TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET - twitter consumer secret (needed for tweets slider).
* TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY - twitter access token key (needed for tweets slider).
* TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET - twitter access token secret (needed for tweets slider).
* GOOGLE_ANALYTICS - google analytics app id
* SHOW_FEEDBACK - flag to activate the landing's page feedback form. In order, to activate it must be set to `true`.

## Usage
To run the project in development mode you need to execute the following command on your terminal:
```

npm run dev

```
This will run the project on `127.0.0.1:3000`  on your browsers window, with hot-reload activated.
To run the project in production mode you need to:
First, build the project for production with the following command:
```

 npm run build

 ```
 This will build the project in production mode with minification.

 Afterwards you'll need to run the production server with the following command:
 ```

 npm start

 ```
 This will run the project on `127.0.0.1:5000`  on your browser's window on production mode.

### Deploy
To deploy the app you'll need to setup a server running `node` with the version specified in the requirements. In the server, you'll need to create a `.env` file containing your desired environmental variables for that application's instance.

If you set up the server to do a clean installation – removing and reinstalling all dependencies – after each deploy, you don't have to worry about building for production.
The project is already configured for making a build after installing, this is being done through the `package.json` **postinstall** hook.
However, if you wish to set up your own deployment flow you just need to ensure you build for production first and start the server last. This is possible running:

 ```

npm run build
npm start

```
As an example if you wish to deploy to **Heroku** you can do it in the following way:
First, install [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli). Once you have heroku installed, run:
```

heroku login

```
Second, create a [named app on Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/creating-apps#creating-a-named-app).
Clone the DATA4SDG-Highways into your Heroku app:
```

heroku git:clone -a <NAME_OF_HEROKU_APP>
cd <NAME_OF_HEROKU_APP>

```
Finally, deploy:
```

git push heroku master

```
